## Woocommerce and Sage 9.0.0-beta.4

With the help of [@mtx-z](https://github.com/mtx-z) and his helpfull post on the [Roots discource forum](https://discourse.roots.io/t/controller-and-woocommerce/9469/5) and a colleague I created this Github Repository for spreading the love.

This is the way I got Sage 9 and Woocommerce working together, might not be the proper way, but it works.

I will try to keep it up to date with my further changes I will make. 

Please feel free to fork, star, create and edit, make pull requests and what not.

#### Files that helped

Here are some files I found very helpfull when creating the actual templates.
I ran into some problems on what is available with `$product` and what isn't, these files made it a lot clearer on what is what and how to use.

- `woocommerce/includes/wc-template-hooks.php`
- `woocommerce/includes/wc-core-functions.php`
- `woocommerce/includes/abstracts/abstract-wc-product.php`

#### Notes / Comments

Each individual file has their own notes at the top. 
If there are multiple functions, methods and what not's are in the file, then each of them have their own notes.

#### Issues

Feel free to post issues, I will do my best to answer them correctly.

#### Thanks
